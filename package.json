  "description": "hnk-jasmine is a collection of small helper functions for testing Node.js code in Jasmine. It includes: - co   - modify jasmine's `it` function to accept generator function - mock   - this method assumes you use monk (mongodb driver) in your code   - mock your database for e2e testing. It is fast enough to mock the whole collection for every function calls - gendoc   - create readme.md documenting everything described by your test case   - use this script and never have an outdated doc ever again - supertest   - properly print stack trace when your server-side code throw exception (and usually returns 500)   - simplify supertest assertion by the following assumption     - every http request would check for http status of 200 by default     - inputing number would check for http status     - inputing regexp would check the response text with http status of 400",
